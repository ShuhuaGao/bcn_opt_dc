# Optimal Control of Boolean Control Networks with Discounted Cost
Code accompanying the paper "Shuhua Gao *et al.* Optimal Control of Boolean Control Networks with Discounted Cost: An Efficient Approach based on Deterministic Markov Decision Process" 

**Requirement**

Python 3.6 or higher.

Packages:

+ [networkx]( https://pypi.org/project/networkx/ ) required for our graphical approach
+ [numpy]( https://pypi.org/project/numpy/ ) required for the algebraic approach


**How to run**

+ Download or clone this repository to your local computer.

+ In the command line  (such as *cmd*, *PowerShell* on Windows or *terminal* on Ubuntu), go into the *code* folder

+ To run an example, say *ara_operon.py*, just type `python ./ara_operon.py`. (Of course, you can also use any IDEs like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code as you want.)
